# Song Planner API

This project is a REST API built with FastAPI that implements role-based access control using JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens. It manages real data on song selections for church services across a network of churches, storing it in a PostgreSQL database. The API uses SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic for database migrations and follows test-driven development with pytest. It was developed to deepen understanding of REST API design, modern security practices, Docker containerization, and AWS deployment.
